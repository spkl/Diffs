# Diffs
Provides a .NET Standard and .NET Core implementation to the diff algorithm (shortest edit script) described by Eugene Myers in "An O(ND) Difference Algorithm and Its Variations". Unlike some other implementations, this one can compare sequences of any object type, using the standard Equals method or a custom IEqualityComparer.
